The elderly community is growing due to increasing life expectancy and an aging population. The elderly and people with cognitive impairment have a higher risk of infection. These vulnerable groups may experience more severe symptoms of infection. The elderly and people with dementia are more prone to social isolation, loneliness, agitation, depression and stress. 'Personal assistive robot' (Paro) is a socially interactive robot that can be used in such situations, which has positive effects on mental well-being. Often, there is only 1 Paro available within a residential group. The robotic technology incorporated in Paro makes cleaning a challenge. This raises concerns that Paro could contribute to the spread of microorganisms.

This research was conducted to develop and optimize a method to measure the level of contamination on Paro and to identify the microbial community. Here are the scripts and commands used in the data analysis.
